There's a piece of paper taped on my wall. It reads:

> You do not have to be good
> You do not have to walk on your knees
> For a hundred miles through the desert, repenting
> You only have to let the soft animal of your body
> Love what it loves.
> 
> &mdash; Mary Oliver, Wild Geese

I remember reading it around a year ago from [Austin Kleon's blog](https://austinkleon.com/2019/01/17/you-do-not-have-to-be-good/), and it just stuck with me. I've come to be the kind of person who has to make something perfect before I could be satisfied. Maybe that's why I have never come to be satisfied in the hobbies that I picked up over the past few years. Initially there's this excitement about learning something new and unexpectedly brilliant, and then slowly it would require more effort to produce the same amount of satisfaction that you had in the beginning. I guess you can call it the opposite of the Law of Diminishing Returns &mdash; to continue getting more out of something, you have to wait a little longer.

But striving for perfet



1. workable
2. fun
