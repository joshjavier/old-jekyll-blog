This is my first post. Yayyy! ðŸŽ‰

I've actually been playing around with the source code since late last year, getting everything "perfect" instead of writing. My inner critic is getting in my own way, and I forgot why I wanted to do this in the first place: to keep learning while having fun.

So there, I finally hit publish.

I'll keep working on this project incrementally, with a reminder to take it slow, make mistakes, and have fun.

After all, what's the point of doing things if you don't?
