# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Josh

<br>

Welcome to my little corner of the Internet.

I'm still learning the basics of setting up my own site, so my digital garden is still quite bare.

Here's a list of things I'm currently working on:

- reading about the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)
- setting up a microblog
- [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/joshjavier/100-days-of-code)

In the meantime, you can say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshjavierr) or [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/joshjavier).
