Welcome to my blog.

Well, that's one of the things I hope to build here. In truth, I want this site to be so much more&mdash;a [digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) or a [memex](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/about.html) where I can break stuff, experiment, and simmer my ideas so they can see the light of day (rather than lost in the void forever).

This project is a work-in-progress, but it's currently in active development, so expect things to change quite drastically as I tinker with stuff. :)

Anyway, a few things about me:

- works at Spiralytics as a content strategist
- lives in a small apartment that he's struggling to clean
- learns coding - namely HTML, CSS, Python, Apps Script, and whatever he finds interesting
- likes tinkering with spreadsheets
- loves cats but has yet to be a hooman to one
