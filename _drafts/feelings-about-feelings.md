I'm having a hard time forcing myself to write. And I know exactly why: I'm censoring myself, editing the last sentence that I just wrote, scrutinizing it to see if there's anything wrong with it, anything offensive, anything that can be criticized by other people. If I can catch it first, then I'd be safe from all the harsh criticisms from other people. Right?

Yeah. But I also would not be growing.

I've been thinking a lot about growth mindset. Anything self-help used to pique my interest; now I take it with a grain of salt. I guess this started when I rewatched *Fight Club* more than a couple of times. "[Self-improvement is masturbation](https://talktomejohnnie.com/self-improvement-is-masturbation/)," as Tyler Durden would say. Or maybe it's from reading Mark Manson's orange book a couple of years ago. Maybe it's just me growing tired because I haven't been getting the instant results that the same self-help books are promising.

Or maybe I'm just too damned afraid of failing.
