Writing. Blogging. Amidst the pandemic. When it feels like writer's block and lots of other worries we have are incomparable to the thousands of people who are sick or at risk and don't have the means to protect themselves and their families, let alone survive for another day. Makes you feel guilty that you can't do more. Can't save lives like a doctor or a health worker does.

But it's okay. Life goes on. I don't mean that these are not real issues that need attention. The danger is real, but that doesn't mean we should stop living. Hold our breath so that we could simulate how sick people must be feeling. That would be dishonest, patronizing.

A lot of people are not from the medical field, and that's okay. Everything doesn't have to be about the coronavirus. Writers can continue worrying about running out of ideas, and artists can keep worrying about not actually putting pen to paper.

What's the point? Do I need to have one?
